Spring Into Action Notes

1.1 Simplifying Java Development
	Four key strategies
		1. Lightweight, minimally invasive development with POJOs
		2. Loose coupling through Dependency Injection and interface orientation
		3. Declarative programming through aspects and common conventions
		4. Eliminating boilerplate code with aspects and templates
	
1.1.1 Unleashing the power of POJOs

		Not forced to implement Spring-specific interface or class
		
1.1.2 Injecting Dependencies
